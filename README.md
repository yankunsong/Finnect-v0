# Finnect: Hybrid Work Engagement Portal

### Problem to Solve

Modern hybrid work environments present unique challenges for organizations like FINRA:

- **Engagement Gaps:** Without a unified platform, maintaining a sense of community, sharing timely company updates, and ensuring smooth logistical transitions become difficult.
